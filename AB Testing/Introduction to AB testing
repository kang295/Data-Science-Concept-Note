**Why is AB Testing important?**
-  It helps us make informed decisions based on data, rather than guesswork or intuition.

**AB Testing Procedure**

1. Problem Statement (Business Goal): What is the goal of the experiment?
- ex) online clothing store called 'FashinWebStore' wants to test a new ranking algorithm (Recommendation System) to provide products more
relevant to customers

- Understanding User Journey: Clearly defining the user journey of a product demonstrates your product knowledge and creates
a success metric

- Success Metrics: Keep in mind that when you create metrics, you want to consider these
a) Measurable (Can the behavior be tracked using the data you collect from users)
b) Attributable (Can you assign the behavior (effect) to the treatment (cause))
c) Sensitive (Does the metric have low variability that you can distinguish the treatment from control)
d) Timely (Can you measure the success behavior in a short term)
<In this case, the revenue per day per user>

2. Hypothesis Testing: What result do you hypothesize from the experiment?
- ex) 

3. Design the Experiment: What are your experiment parameters?
4. Run the Experiment: What are the requirements for running an experiment?
5. Validity Checks: Did the experiment run soundly without errors or bias?
6. Interpret Results: In which direction is the metric significant statistically and practically?
7. Launch Decision: Based on the results and trade-offs, should the change launch?
